# Aircraft-war-game


The 2D air combat game based on Pygame includes core functions such as player control, automatic movement of enemy planes, bullet firing and explosion special effects. Control the fighter plane through the key, and the space bar fires bullets to shoot down enemy planes.

functional performance
Player control: support the direction key (←↓→) to move the fighter, and the space bar fires three rounds of bullets.
Behavior of enemy aircraft: The enemy aircraft automatically moves left and right, and automatically turns when touching the boundary.
Collision detection: an accurate collision judgment system between bullets and enemy planes
Explosion special effect: 6-frame sequence animation blasting effect
Resource management: integrated picture resource loading and rendering system
Installation and operation
environmental requirement
bash
Python 3.8+
pip install pygame
quick start
Clone warehouse:
bash
Gitclone https://github.com/ Your username/warehouse name. git
Ensure that the resource file is stored in the. /aircraft_war_material/ directory.
Run the game:
bash
python aircraft_war.py
Code structure analysis
python
# Player Fighter Control Logic
def hero_plane():
Global hero_x, hero_y # uses global variables to store fighter coordinates.
# Event Listener Handles WASD and Spacebar
# Bullet objects are stored as a dictionary list containing coordinate information.

# Enemy aircraft behavior system
def enemy_plane():
Global enemy_x, enemy_path # Automatic moving path calculation
# Collision detection: (bullet _ x ≥ enemy _ x)&&(bullet _ x ≤ enemy _ x+165)
# The explosion animation sequence is realized by blow_up array.

# Game main loop
def main():
Pygame.display.set_caption ("Aircraft Wars") # Window Title Settings
While True: # Game loop framework
Screen.blit(background, (0,0)) # background rendering
Pygame.display.update() # screen refresh
Resource file description
The following picture resources (recommended size) must be included:

background.png (400x800)
Hero1.png (recommended 100x100)
enemy2.png (165x265)
Explosion sequence frames enemy2_down1.png to enemy2 _ down6.png.
Development roadmap
Add scoring system
Realize the generation of multiple enemy planes
Add sound system
Develop the mechanism of increasing difficulty of checkpoints
matters need attention
The resource path needs to keep the directory structure of. /aircraft_war_material/.
It is recommended to use pygame version 2.1.3+(verified by pip show pygame).
The game refresh rate is controlled by time.sleep(0.01), which can be adjusted to change the game speed.
